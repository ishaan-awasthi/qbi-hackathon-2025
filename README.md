Three sentence team project summary:

Single nucleotide polymorphism in ABC transporters contributes to inter-individual differences for susceptibility for the disease or various therapies is associated with clinical conditions, which makes it important to study. SNPs can be prioritized for functional and clinical studies by analyzing interactions (H-bonds, steric clashes, non-polar interactions) of these specific residues before and after mutation in different conformational states using molecular visualization structural tools. Automating the above mentioned process of in-silico screening of SNPs into a tool, “SNP-automate” in combination with genome sequencing of patients can be a boon to the field of precision medicine.
